The objective of the project is to show the process of configuring the ChirpStack Network Server on both Ubuntu 22.04 which runs inside a Virtual machine and on Windows OS. This process involves configuring the ChirpStack Network Server to which a gateway will be initialized. Subsequently, a device will be assigned to this gateway to facilitate uplink and downlink operations. The data from these operations will be stored in an InfluxDB database which will be integrated into Chirpstack Network Server. This database is configured with Grafana to enable the visualization and analysis of the data on web pages. These Grafana dashboards are later embedded into an application, which will also be used to send downlinks to LoRa Device through UI.
